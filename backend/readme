# Appoinement application

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone "url" or download it  
$ cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python3 -m env venv
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `venv`.

Note that in requirement.txt there is a packages that i clone from my github repository if. make safe if u run :
-e git://github.com/TheGhostDevlopper/osm-jet@master#egg=osm-jet
```sh
(env)$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

to not override it .

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ python manage.py makesmigration
(env)$ python manage.py migrate
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

add new admin 
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
test admin : macbook pass : 123

Take note that there is db.sqlite3 in the project .
